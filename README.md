## Project Description
A command-line authentication system implementing secure password hashing
This system allows users to register accounts and log in with proper password verification.

## Features
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with automatic salt generation
- User registration with duplicate username prevention
- User login with password verification
- Input validation for usernames and passwords
- File-based user data persistence

## Technical Implementation
- Hashing Algorithm: bcrypt with automatic salting
- Data Storage: Plain text file (`users.txt`) with comma-separated values
- Password Security: One-way hashing, no plaintext storage
- Validation:
- Username: 3-20 alphanumeric characters, no spaces
- Password: (6-50 characters, must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character)
